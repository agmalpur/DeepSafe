# Deepfake Attacks Prevention

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and preventing deepfake attacks using advanced methodologies. Deepfakes, generated through AI-based techniques, pose significant security threats, making it crucial to develop robust detection mechanisms.

## Features
- Identification of deepfake-generated images and videos
- Implementation of machine learning techniques for detection
- Prevention mechanisms to mitigate deepfake threats

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Input deepfake media files for analysis.
- The system provides a confidence score regarding the authenticity of the content.
- Possible countermeasures can be applied based on detection results.
